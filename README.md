This repository contains solutions to two algorithmic problems involving arrays, set operations, and vector dot products. 
Both problems follow the required algorithmic constraints such as using arrays, procedures/functions, and nested loops.

Goal 1:
Find the sum of elements present in exactly one of the two sets.
Goal 2:
Compute dot product of two vectors.
Check if vectors are orthogonal (dot product = 0)
